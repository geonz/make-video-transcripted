<p>  Mastering Multiplication:   These are the times! Let's get to the facts!</p>

<p> I’d like to introduce you to multiplication.   </p>

<p>Multiplication is where, for lots of people, math became something to memorize.
Well, memorizing is a good thing, and that’s a big part of this little course.</p>

<p>

We’re going to approach it, though, from understanding numbers and how they work.   It’s like riding a bike or driving a car – it’s good to know how to use it, but it’s even better to understand how it works. </p>

<p>Why should you bother?   </p>

<p> 
It’s an investment – work harder now, work easier later. 
especially because understanding makes the brain remember things better. 
You just might surprise yourself.
